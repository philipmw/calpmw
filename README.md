This is a small command-line utility I wrote in 2009 to solve the same problem (for myself) that Todoist solves today.

The utility's purpose is to output a list of upcoming events, both recurring and one-time.
If I don't mark an event as completed, the utility shows it as overdue.

For posterity, I'm even including my actual data files (with real events from 2009).  It's a nice time capsule.

This is on GitHub just for archival purposes.  I don't advise anyone to actually use it. :)
